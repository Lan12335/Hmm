RECEIVER is the 1st made receiver code for LGT RF nano, located on wallet...

TRANS is the 1st made transmitter code for Arduino UNO R3, located on doorknob...

Transm FINAL is a code for TRANS but does not have Serial.print functions...

new transmitter(unsure) is the 2nd made code for the transmitter for Arduino UNO R3, located on the doorknob. 
This code is a lot more simpler and does not use psuedo random...

new transmitter(w/SD) is the 3rd made code for the transmitter, is experimental and will only be viable if
we can use the nRF24L01 module with the SD card adaptor module in the same circuit...

Arduino Research[folder] it is a folder from my computer in where I edit from VS code or Arduino IDE software 

jun4REC is the latest code for the receiver, for arduino LGT RF nano board

jun4TRAN is the latest code for the transmitter, for arduino UNO R3
